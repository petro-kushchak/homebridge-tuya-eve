Any help is welcome!

## Note

This repository is created because there is no support for switch type accessories on iRayanKhan's homebridge-tuya repository. Once he merges my commits or adds support for switch type accessories himself, you should go and use his plugin. This plugin supports ONLY switch type accessories.
